            <h1 id="usufruct">Usufruct</h1>

<p>Usufruct is a legal concept referring to a right in property which confers on the holder the right to use and benefit from the property without altering, damaging, or destroying it. A usufructary does not own the property but does have a legal interest in it which is sanctioned or contractually allowed by the owner.</p>

<p>A usufructary has two of the three civilian property property interests in the property, <em>usus</em> and <em>fructus</em>— they do not have the interest of <em>abusus</em>, which entitles them to alienate, destroy, consume or sell the property.</p>

<h2 id="the-three-civilian-property-interests">The three civilian property interests:</h2>

<ul>
  <li>
<strong>Usus:</strong> The right to use or enjoy a thing posessed, directly and without alteration</li>
  <li>
<strong>Fructus:</strong> The right to derive profit from a thing possessed, eg. by lease, cultivation, taxing on entry, etc. <em>Fructus</em> (from ‘fruit’) allows a person to benefit from the sale of renewable commodities of the property.</li>
  <li>
<strong>Abusus:</strong> The right to consume, destroy, or transfer the property. This interest is not conferred upon the usufructary.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="notes">Notes:</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Roman law considered usufruct a type of personal servitude, where the usufructary had no posession of the property. Under a rental agreement today, a person has even more restricted rights over a property than did a usufructary in Rome, but is yet not considered a personal servant.</li>
  <li>The Law of Modes directed owners of productive property not to harvest the edges of their fields so that the poor may collect the gleanings. This confers a kind of usufructary right by default onto the poor.</li>
  <li>“Earth belongs – in usufruct – to the living.” (Thomas Jefferson).</li>

            <h1 id="dopamine-l-dopa-and-pattern-detection">Dopamine, L-dopa and Pattern Detection</h1>
<p>Production of neurotransmitter dopamine is stimulated by novelty, and it facilitates learning, information storage and pattern-recognition, as well as regulating emotion. Pattern-detection is important to learning, because the brain is able to compress complex raw data by identifying repetitious elements and storing information in association with the pattern, rather than making space for each node of information to be stored separately. For example, there is no need to memorize 1000 patterns of digits in order to count from 1 to 1000; the pattern is regular enough that the brain can derive each integer from a pattern it has stored, without storing each data point that the pattern produces.</p>

<p>However, patterns are not pure representations of the world, or even of the data being apprehended by the brain— they are mnemonic data structures which necessarily reduce the complexity of information in order to store it more efficiently. Pattern-matching is generally considered to be helpful for learning, and this may be true is learning is equated with remembering. However, is learning-as-remembering conducive to understanding? Sensitivity to pattern-detection can be alternately phrased as tendency to apply narrative. Humans cannot resist but apply narrative to phenomena, and it seems that a compulsion to apprehend data in a logical or causal sequence is deeply ingrained in the human brain, ported over from a form of intelligence that evolved to understand the physical world, where causality is a ubiquitous feature. For this reason, making judgements on inert data is a human default, and takes serious conscious effort to avoid.</p>

<p>It is therefore unsurprising that dopamine also lowers skepticism. If logical sequences (patterns) appear more readily, an inflated subset of chaotic phenomena appears to ‘make sense’, and so the suspension of belief is more easily overcome. L-dopa, a drug which is metabolized as dopamine and used to treat Parkinson’s, makes people more vulnerable to pattern-detection, and has a notable side-effect that causes some patients to develop sudden gambling additions— patients see clear patterns in random phenomena, leading them to believe they will be more successful than they will be in reality.</p>

<p><strong>Summary:</strong> Pattern detection is conducive to memorization, but not necessarily to clear thinking; in many instances apprehension of a pattern is a reduction of phenomena too complex to be faithfully reduced. Heightened dopamine can bolster addictive compulsions and increase credulousness, as patterns are more readily detected and chaotic sequences of action appear to make more sense. Pattern-detection is enhanced by dopamine production, and tendencies to compulsive action can result.</p>

<h1 id="configure-exocore-for-personal-use">Configure Exocore for Personal Use</h1>
<h2 id="change-your-username-and-homepage">Change your Username and Homepage</h2>
<p>Navigate to <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">/exocore/data/user.yml</code>. Open the file in any text-editor (e.g. Notepad or TextEdit) and look for <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">user_name: Remilia Corporation</code>. Change this to whatever name you want to appear on the left sidebar.</p>
<h2 id="change-your-homepage-content">Change your Homepage Content</h2>
<p>In the same <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">/exocore/data/user.yml</code> file, you will also see <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">welcome_header</code> and <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">welcome_subtitle</code>. These control the title and subtitle that appear on your homepage.</p>
<p>On the root folder you will find <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">index.md</code>, this can be edited like any other article as your homepage with the addition of the title and header from the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">user.yml</code> file. Make sure you keep the following frontmatter at the top of the markdown file:</p>
<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>---layout: hometitle: home---</code></pre></div></div>
<h2 id="change-your-profile-picture">Change your Profile Picture</h2>
<p>The profile picture that appears on the left sidebar is located at <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">assets/img/pfp.png</code>, you can replace this file with any .png. Note that it will be resized into a square.</p>
<h2 id="change-your-social-media-card-image">Change your Social Media Card Image</h2>
<p>The social media card that appears when your site is linked on social media sites like Twitter, Facebook, etc. is located at <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">assets/img/card.png</code>, you can replace this file with any .png. Note that a dimension of 1200x630 is recommended.</p>
<p>Make sure the site’s url is changed in <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">/_config.yml</code> in the next step for this image to appear.</p>
<h2 id="change-your-sites-title-and-url">Change your Site’s Title and URL</h2>
<p>Navigate to <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">/_config.yml</code> to change the Title and URL of your exocore. All other settings can be left as is.</p>
<h2 id="change-the-theme">Change the Theme</h2>
<p>The Exocore ships with multiple themes to choose from. Navigate to <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">/styles.scss</code> and look for the line that says <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">//Uncomment one of the following lines to choose a theme:</code>. To select a theme, remove <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">//</code> from the line of the theme you want to try, and add <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">//</code> to the previously active theme (“yotsuba” by default).</p>
<h2 id="optional-password-protection">Optional: Password Protection</h2>
<p>You can add simple password protection by going to your Netlify account, entering your site, going to <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Settings &gt; Build &amp; Deploy &gt; Build Settings &gt; Edit Settings</code> and changing <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Build commannd</code> from the default <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">bundle exec jekyll build</code> to: <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">jekyll build &amp;&amp; npx staticrypt _site/index.html P@SSW0RD -o _site/index.html</code></p>
<p>This will password protect the homepage with <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">P@SSWORD</code> as the password – you can change this to anything you’d like. Note that this will only protect the homepage, users will be able to directly link to any other page and have access to the whole site.</p>
