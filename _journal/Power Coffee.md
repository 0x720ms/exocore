# Power Coffee
| [[Coffee]] | One cup |
| [[Creatine]] | 100mg |
| [[L-Theanine]] | 200mg |

## Interactivity

### L-Theanine and Caffeine
L-Theanine is an amino acid found in green tea. It regulates the GABA system that's responsible for feelings of calm while reducing stress and anxiety; it also enhances the alpha brain waves associated with the state of wakeful relaxation as well as in REM sleep.

### Creatine

### Does Creatine and Caffeine conflict?
It was once thought that caffeine blunted the performance-enhancing benefits of creatine. This myth stems from a [single 1996 study that only had 9 respondents](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/8929583/) that hasn't been replicated in follow-up research.

A 2017 study that took place over 5 days split 54 males into four groups ([5Trusted Source](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4808512/)):

-   anhydrous caffeine (300 mg) with creatine (20 grams)
-   instant coffee (300 mg caffeine) with creatine (20 grams)
-   creatine only (20 grams)
-   a placebo group

Results showed no significant differences in power and sprinting performance among all groups. Participants taking caffeine and creatine reported greater digestive discomfort, though ([5Trusted Source](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4808512/)).

A 2015 review of research found no pharmacokinetic interactions — in other words, how the body affects a drug — between caffeine and creatine. Moreover, they found that multi-ingredient supplements containing both creatine and caffeine may support strength and power performance ([6Trusted Source](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26219105/)).

Due to conflicting reports of combined caffeine and creatine on athletic performance, more research is needed.

Though research on the effectiveness of the two ingredients combined is scarce, their individual benefits in sports and athletic performance are widely accepted ([3Trusted Source](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5469049/), [7Trusted Source](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30926628/), [8Trusted Source](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33388079/), [9Trusted Source](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29876876/)).
