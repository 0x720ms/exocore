### Origins
 its history dates back to 1970’s when Mr. Teizo Miyazato who dubbed as a father of Okinawa’s tourism industry visited Hawaii. Seeing aloha shirts worn by local Hawaiians, he came up with an idea of making similar shirts in Okinawa with different designs suitable for Okinawa climate. He selected designs from among the public, named the shirt as “Okinawa Shirt” and then began to sell it.Going through changes in names several times, it was settled as "Kariyushi" in 1990.

“It all started around 1970 with a product called Okinawa Shirt,” said Eiko Oshiro, the CEO of Nisshin Shokai, a company that makes the popular MAJUN brand of Kariyushi shirts. “Teizo Miyazato, the president of Okinawa Hotel who headed the union that oversaw all hotels on the island, went to Hawaii and came up with an idea for our own version of Aloha Shirt to help promote tourism on Okinawa.

“I was involved in that process. We made muumuu as well,” Oshiro recalled. “We asked the Okinawa prefectural government for support, but officials were very hesitant to help us … they said they didn’t like the design of Kariyshi shirts very much.”
