# Neck Training

>“If I want to find out how much physical force a man possesses, or is likely to possess in a dormant state, I look at his neck. That never fails to answer my question. In both men and the other male beasts, the neck has always been the true indication of a quality and quantity of his concentrated nerve power. A strong healthy man always has a powerful neck, and he always will have one.”
>– George Jowett, The Key to Might and Muscle.

Most bodybuilding is not visible in standard formalwear outside the neck, wrists and shoulders. Training the neck is the biggest, fastest contribution to aesthetics despite it being often forgotten in workout routines. It's also the most important muscle to protect both the head and the spine, which is why it's a primary focus for wrestlers and martial artists.

## 1. Wrestler's Bridge
Wrestlers traditionally have some of the biggest necks on Earth, and their preferred method for building them is the wrestler's bridge done in volume:

>One of the most economical methods in terms of time and rapid return in gains is performing neck bridges daily. For trainees just beginning neck work it is recommended the volume be gradual.
>1. Start with five reps on the forehead and five reps on the back of the head. Add a repetition or two. When you achieve twenty reps split into a twice daily routine.
>2. Complete upon rising and prior to going to bed. 
>3. Stretch post training and throughout the day. We have experienced trainees gaining two inches in six weeks.


Hold for 60 seconds twice a day

>Lie on floor, heels to butt. Place cushion under head. 

## 3. Bridge-Ups

> **"Bridge-ups**  
> 1.  Start lying on your back with the palms of your hands resting on your stomach.
> 2.  Get into your neck bridge. Make sure your feet are flat on the mat and you are supporting your weight on the back of your head. (Your back should not be touching the mat.)
> 3.  Use your feet to push off the mat and arch up. As you do this, “roll” on your head so that the very top of your head is touching the mat. Arch up as high as you can — try to touch your forehead or nose to the mat.
> 4.  As you arch up, extend your arms along the mat next to your head. The backs of your hands should touch the mat when you are fully arched.
> 5.  Lower your body and return to your original position. Move your arms down towards your legs and rest them on your stomach. Don’t let your back fall to the mat, support yourself!
> 6.  Repeat this motion for 20-25 repetitions.

## 4. Neck Flexion
A bodyweight exercise you can do anywhere while seated:
>1. While standing, clasp your hands behind your head and press your head forward. 
>2. Now try to resist your hand pressure and push your head back.
>3. Clasp your hands on your forehead, and repeat in the opposite direction
>4. Repeat for 5 reps, gradually increase to 20 reps.

The same procedure can be done with a neck harness and weights. The key on extensions is to “squash the bug” on your upper chest with your chin, then get a full contraction and contemplate the ceiling for a moment.

## Goal: Hold a Neck Plank for 60 seconds
This is an advanced exercise for the front of the neck, it is very difficult given the poor leverages, but if you can do this for 60 seconds straight you will notice significant improvements in your neck size.
