Powder, mixed into Chamomile Tea. These supplements are generally useful for cognition beyond sleep, however you can add 300mg of [Valerian Root Powder](https://examine.com/supplements/valerian/research/#neurology_DQSC-sleep-and-sedation) to further target sleep specifically.

## Importance of Sleep

## Benefits to Sleep

### Magnesium Glycinate

Magnesium plays an important role in sleep regulation[^# The effect of magnesium supplementation on primary insomnia in elderly: A double-blind placebo-controlled clinical trial. https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/23853635/], with magnesium deficiencies correlated to insomnia and poor sleep quality (as well as anxiety, depression and migraines). Magnesium will also help regulate cortisol (stress) which affects sleep quality.

Magnesium is elemental, so it is always sold as a compound, e.g. magnesium citrate, oxide, aspartate, chloride. For example, magnesium oxide is one magnesium atom bound together with one oxygen atom. It is “MgO”. An oxygen atom has a molar mass of 16, and a magnesium atom has a molar mass of 24. The entire molecule has a molar mass of 40 (16 +24). So in one molecule of magnesium oxide, we have 16/40 or 40% oxygen, and 24/40 or 60% magnesium; and 100 mg of pure magnesium oxide has 60 mg of “elemental” magnesium.

Magnesium Glycinate (also known as magnesium bisglycinate) is a recommended form to take magnesium as magnesium citrate has a laxative effect and [magnesium oxate is not very bioavailable](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/11794633/). You should be careful to check the supplement's label to make sure your magnesium gylcinate is not buffered with other less desirable forms of magnesium. About 10% of unbuffered, unfilled magnesium glycinate is elemental magnesium. Magnesium chloride is recommended for topical application.

### Glycine
Glycine is the simplest amino acid in nature, with a single hydrogen atom as its side chain, and the primary amino acid of collagen; collagenous proteins are the best natural source of glycine. 

Glycine is [well noted](https://examine.com/supplements/glycine/research/#neurology_X3jm-sleep-and-sedation) to improve sleep quality with shortened time to reach slow wave sleep. You'll note vivid dreams and reduced fatigue in the morning.

It also has cognitive benefits beyond the advantages provided by deeper sleep as well as helps with muscle recovery after exercise.

### L-Theanine

L-Theanine is an amino acid found in green tea. It regulates the GABA system that's responsible for feelings of calm while reducing stress and anxiety; it also [enhances the alpha brain waves](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25759004/) associated with the state of wakeful relaxation as well as in REM sleep. [Further Reading](https://www.getproper.com/blog/l-theanine-sleep).

Note, L-Theanine is also useful at a similar 200mg dose in conjunction with coffee/caffeine to boost its cognitive functions.

### Valerian Root Powder
 Pungent valerian plant — its smell has been [compared to gym socks](https://www.va.gov/WHOLEHEALTHLIBRARY/tools/botanical-medicines-healthy-sleep-rest.asp) — has been used for sleep problems [since the 2nd century](https://ods.od.nih.gov/factsheets/Valerian-HealthProfessional/). [Meta-analysis](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/17145239/).
  
The roots and stems of the valerian plant are made into teas, tinctures, capsules, extracts, and tablets. While each type of preparation has its fans, the tea can have an unpleasant odor, and researchers generally use liquid extracts or capsules in their research.

### Chamomile Tea
German chamomile has been used to treat sleep problems [since ancient Egypt23](https://www.nccih.nih.gov/health/chamomile). [Meta-analysis](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31006899/) and is easily available at any market's herbal tea section. Other herbal teas with long traditions of use to aid sleep you can consider: valerian root, magnolia bark, lavender, and passionflower.

## Why not Melatonin?
Melatonin is a seratonin metabolite.
