# Metabolic Switch 3 Week Diet
Designed to reset your body's rhythm, specifically targeting the hormone leptin to help your body regulate fat storage at a lower body weight on a long-term basis.

## About Metabolic Switching

Metabolic switching is one of the key factors behind evolution, Mattson claims. Individuals who thrived despite long durations of food scarcity — that is, their brain and body function improved when they fasted — were more successful at surviving. During a period of food scarcity or fasting, the metabolism of the body switches: the cells break down the easily accessible stores of sugar or glucose and fat to get fuel. If paired with exercise or physical activity, this metabolic switching results in the depletion of glycogen stores in the liver and fatty acids from adipose cells. What’s more, it also triggers autophagy, which is the body’s way of flushing out damaged cells which can be replaced by newer and healthier ones. This replacement happens when the period of fasting is over and the body goes through a recovery period by eating, resting and sleeping.
