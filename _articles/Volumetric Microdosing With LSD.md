# Volumetric Microdosing With LSD

 [[Microdosing|Microdosing]], the so-called [[History of Microdosing|third wave]] of psychedelics, has revealed itself to be the proper way to take psychedelics--in retrospect, the standard trip doses were overdoses. The best dosing method is volumetric with LSD tabs diluted in alcohol or distilled water.

## Why You Should Avoid Cutting Tabs

Crudest LSD microdosing method is cutting up tabs into 1/10 pieces, eyeballing the dosage by the size of the paper. However this isn’t ideal:

-   **LSD is not always laid perfectly evenly.** In the manufacturing process, sheets are soaked in a liquid LSD solution, then dried – but sometimes this drying does not occur perfectly evenly, leaving some sections of the paper more concentrated than others. Because LSD is so potent with standard doses already measured in microgams, and you're taking ~1/10 that for your microdose, the tiny amounts introduce major variations in concentration from one millimeter to the next.
-   **It risks degrading your LSD.** Unless you’re wearing gloves, it’s possible that your sweaty grasp could start to degrade the tab during your cutting session.
- **It's inaccurate.** Street tabs are unreliably dosed. You'll want to find an accurate and consistent microdose by carefully scaling up and settling on the perfect dose. This is also important if you're getting tabs from multiple sources.

## How to Volumetric Dose

Volumetric dosing is the most reliable method for microdosing LSD, both in accuracy and for long term storage. All you need is a small bottle ([ideally amber](https://www.amazon.com/Dropper-Bumobum-Essential-Tincture-Measured/dp/B09ZP8NXCD/)), a 1ml syringe, and either distilled water or alcohol.

Alcohol preserves the LSD better – but distilled water is fine for a period of a few months. **Do not use tap water, it will degrade your LSD.**

Vodka is perfect. If you use pure ethanol,  you’ll probably want to dilute it with distilled water for ease of consumption.

Fill up your bottle with 10ml of distilled water or alcohol for every 100ug of LSD (standard street dosage is 100ug to a tab).

Shake the bottle around a bit, and leave it at room temperature or in the fridge for 48 hours. Do not freeze or heat the bottle. If the bottle is clear, not amber, wrap aluminum foil around it to prevent the LSD from being degraded by light.

After 48 hours, your LSD will be fully dissolved into the liquid. The paper will still be there – however, the LSD that has been laid on the blotter paper will have dissolved.

Now, you just need to take qml with your syringe for a 10ug dose. If you microdose with less or more than 10ug, simply scale it to your volume – 0.5ml is 5ug, 2ml is 20ug, and so on.

## Alternative to Syringe
If you don’t have a 1ml syringe, and don’t want to buy one, you can just scale up the volumes using standard sized 15m shotglasses. Put your 100ug tab in 150ml of water/alcohol, then the 15ml shot glass can be used to dose 10ug.

## Microdosing Schemes
Microdosing can be done without harm regularly but must be spaced out to avoid a tolerance build up. The most common dosing scheme is the [[Fadiman Protocol]], 1 day on, 2 days off; however the [[Stamets Stack]] is also worth considering.
