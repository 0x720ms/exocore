# YAYO Radio
The Ideal YAYO Radio for [[Remilia Radio|Remilia Radio]] is split into 6 separate chunks lasting roughly four hours each. We've assembled a number of genres for each block with the intention of mixing things up between different days, possibly differentiating between weekdays and weekends, possibly even splitting certain blocks into distinct 2 hour time segments if applicable.

Note: WIP.

## A. 6AM-10AM: The Morning Block

Music chosen for vitalization, preparation, and spiritual cleansing. The morning is meant for fulfilling nutrition, physical activity, cleaning oneself from the sinful filth of the night, getting ready for work, going to church, and greeting the day. Genres should be positive and familiar in the same sense of breakfast being a routine. Something to listen to during cardio, facial cleanses in front of a foggy mirror, drinking coffee and reading the newspaper.

### A1. Morning Shuffle
Hard to pin down without referencing Oceans 11 and Guy Ritchie movies, but essentially this is borrowed from a bartending playlist I had. Instrumental quirky jazzy electronica/light hip hop beat music that seems most fleshed out in the 90s. Gives the feeling of rapidly organizing objects, a montage flurry of productive micromovements. Good for accelerating preparatory motions that usually come with cooking breakfast, cleaning the house, organizing supplies for the day.

### A2. Classical
Perhaps more specification within genre is needed, but I've found classical music to be the ultimate accoutrement to a shower and shave routine. I am uneducated in the specifics between composers and time periods, my input varies across centuries, would gladly take curation if needed. Assuming we'd play entire individual symphonies and concertos.

### A3. Traditional
Throat Singing Music: There's something holy about it. I think it fits perfectly for the early hours of the morning and is a great way to start the day. It's adjacent to other acoustic vocal music such as orthodox chants, but it's not as conceptually intrusive as monk music.

#### A4. Surf Rock
Surf Rock: A lot of options, very positive late 50s, 60s influence, good for bringing your spirits up and greeting the day. Best for later end of the block.

### A5. Minimalism

## B. 10AM-2PM: The Midday Block

The midday has a lot of variance in schedules and activities, but the ideal YAYO man finds himself most productive during this time. The midday is a delicate balance between accelerating productivity and dipping your toes into leisure.Â  Best for a variety of needs, anything from commutes, lunchbreaks, and computer work to getting a tan at the beach, walking under the shadows of skyscrapers, or doing pull ups at the park.

### B1. 80s Hits
80s Hits: A mish mash of popular power ballads, rock hits, and upbeat pop songs that would be heard on any radio station in the 1980s.

### B2. Commercial Vaporwave

Businesswave/Commercial Vaporwave: A lot of motifs towards 80s electronic proprietary jingles, heavy Wall Street aesthetic energy. A lot may have to dip into other synthwave and electronic genres. Maybe even literal corporate music, but I don't want to just stuff it with boring elevator music.

### B3. Latin World
Latin World: Extremely rough unrefined chunk of music ranging between Miami Cuban vibes to more seductive Mexican to Columbian Cumbia Folktronica etc etc. Vaguely cartelcore music, need to consult hispanic person and refine genres more distinctly.

### B4. Looming Citadel
Looming Citadel: A subset of electronic music which I don't know the right name for, but it gives the feeling of being in an elevator going up a monolithic tower or traveling through a vast black pyramid of a supercorporation.

#### B5. Something's Happening
Something's Happening: A mixture of instrumental, big band, soul, funk, and jazz music handpicked for the natural comedy of its presence when combined with any task or event. Scorcese-esque, it's a delightful accoutrement to conversation or any task.

## C. 2PM - 6PM The Afternoon Block

YAYO Men understand that the afternoon is the greatest part of the day. It represents the YAYO core in perfect harmony, a balance between work and play. Most government and banking schedules end their official work day around this time. The afternoon represents a sort of waning towards leisure, with some productivity remaining until sunset. The feeling of getting off work and driving in the late sun as your mind wanders is the ultimate expression of freedom to both the blue collar urban cowboy and the white collar business criminal. Midday is a blend between Morning and Afternoon vibes. Afternoon Block genres are made for nicotine use, long drives with the window open, day drinking at beach bars, tactical errands, organizing social business, and loosening ones tie.

### C1. Vietnam Helicopter
Vietnam Helicopter: Classic rock. Wood panel cars, yellowed paper photographs, sideburns, diner coffee in styrofoam cups. Something to paddle down a river to. Boomercore lawn mowing music.

### C2. Summercore
Summercore: Distinctly beachy music mixed with Sublime-esque vibes. Surfing and skate parks, the endlessness of teenage time wasting, ocean water and sunburns.

### C3. Desert Cowboy
Desert Cowboy: Something a bit harder than country, even mix of catchy folk music and cowboy rock, with a hint of desert rock. Buick Grand National speeding across Death Valley with the windows down, loaded revolver in the console. Denim outfit and cowboy boots, cocaine in the breast pocket. Smoking inside your car.

### C4. Melted Chocolate
Melted Chocolate: Funk music and adjacent R&B that makes you feel like a sleazy pimp with crocodile skin shoes and a tiger plush seat cadillac.

### C5. Hazy Days
Hazy Days: R/B, blues, and soul music that's not as cartoonish as the melted chocolate playlist. Something for warm afternoons, somewhat wider variety of vibes.

## D. 6PM-10PM: The Evening Block

The ultimate YAYO aesthetic is the sunset. This is when the world is at its most beautiful as the day cools into pinks, purples, and orange glow giving way to the glowing blue of the early night. This time slot is perfect for evening drives across long bridges to downtown where any number of things could happen. Whether the listener quietly grinds at the gym working towards freeing himself from the shackles of a wage or is an entrepreneur enjoying the stillness of travel towards a night of Bacchanalia, the Evening Block is the pinnacle of anticipation distilled into song. Music is chosen for warm, hopeful, and provocative feelings of inspiration, paired with hints of greed, lust, and steady buildup. The Evening Block isn't entirely dominated by nightdrive synthwave, it's also a good time for more alternative genres which fit the coolness of the evening.

### D1. Sunset Drive
Sunset Drive: Synthwave with a slower euphoric feel. Tested out on authentic Florida sunset bridge drives for quality control.

### D2. Loungecore
Loungecore: Similar genre bleedover to the Morning Shuffle, chosen for more relaxed night vibes. Cocktail lounge, hookah lounge, giggling party guests on sofas. A lot of barber beats.

### D3. New Wave
New Wave: Biggest thing that comes to mind would be Talking Heads and New Order, I'm not educated on the intricacies between new wave, post punk, etc but there are some New Wave songs that belong in the 80s Hits block, and some pop or rock songs that don't fit within the categorization of New Wave or Post Punk that still belong here. It's just what feels like it should be listened to at night.

### D4. Muted Dusk
Muted Dusk: Lofi Deep House and anything similar, something with a detached melancholy feeling to it

### D5. Night Hunter

Night Hunter: An even mix of a certain type of alternative indie and a sort of melancholy house/dance etc electronic music (chillwave?). Somewhat aggressive, introspective music for creeping into the night.

## E. 10PM-2AM: The Night Block

This is when the YAYO Man lets loose and parties. The Night Block is for maintaining chaotic high energy in transporation moments between dinner, clubs, bars, parties, and venus. It's when you have an entire car piled up filled with people pumping themselves up as you drive 20 miles over the speed limit. It's when you're redlining your vehicle twice the speed limit on the highway by yourself. It's when the night is at its hardest, the women are wildest, and the consequences are the most dangerous for all parties involved. The Night Block is for driving, dancing, and doing drugs. This block is primarily dominated by electronic music.

### E1. What Is Love
Google defines these as "Electronic Dance" music but that casts such a wide net. Basically it's 90s-2000s club dance music. Originally this block was titled "Blade Club" and it had like Pump Panel - Confusion in the samples but I realized how different that is from this block, so I left it out, I'm sure you could build something much better from that sound.

### E2. Speed and Power
Speed and Power: This is synthwave music specifically chosen for the act of driving fast. It has a lot of subgenre crossover but it's filled with proven winners and I've gotten pulled over multiple times listening to them while speeding.

### E3. Coke Club
Coke Club: A lot of HiNRG, Specifically moreso the post New Order - Blue Monday imitation trends in the mid to late 80s, and similar sounding 80s club music

### E4. Black Strobe
Black Strobe: A rough approximation of dark house music with industrial vibe and heavy bass. A feeling of repressed violence while walking through strobe lights.

## F. 2AM-6AM: The Dark Block

The Dark is distinct from The Night in that the hours of 2AM-6AM shouldn't be experienced by any healthy minded person. If you're listening to music during these hours, you're either defying your own biology towards a pursuit (pleasure or project) or you're coming down off the high energy of a proactive evening. This is historically considered the homespace of the witching hour and is also loneliest point of the day/night cycle. The YAYO Man is no stranger to this time and it is an anything goes period of experimentation, freak encounters, and creeping feelings locked away from normality. The Dark Block has a wide variety of genres for different feelings, and acts as a sort of repository for experimental vibes that don't fit anywhere else.

### F1. Lash Out
A mixture of grunge, metal, and alt rock that has heavy undertones of anger and sadness.

### F2. Sewerlord
Sewerlord: Similar trajectories from Lash Out, but a bit more experimental, weirder vibes mixed with sludgier, grimier, and heavier rock.

### F3. Voodoo
Voodoo: Sun Araw adjacent echoey ambient rhythms with some sinister undertone, mixed with tropical feeling. Definitely need your help fleshing this one out.

### F4. Abyss
Abyss: Full blown detached violence Blood Meridian level grim music. Horror, Drone, Dark Ambient, Somber Alt/Indie music, all picked for a very specific harsh empty alien feeling.

### F5. Off
Off: There isn't an exactly common metric between songs chosen in this genre beyond it sounds sorta "off." A sort of Lynchian undertone, mixed with a Natural Born Killers dreaminess.
