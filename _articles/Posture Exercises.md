# Posture Exercises
Posture has always been one of the most important visual indicators of health and upbringing, but extensive computer and phone use leads to seriously damaged posture in the [[AristoNEETs|hikki]], alongside [[Wrist Pain Exercises|wrist pain]].

This collection of simple posture exercises that can be done standing or sitting while still viewing your computer, easy to do while reading an article or watching a video.

## What does Good Posture Look Like?
When sitting, your feet should rest flat on the floor, with even weight on both hips. Your back should be mostly straight (youâ€™ll have natural curves in your lumbar, thoracic, and cervical areas). Your shoulders should be back but relaxed and your ears should line up over your collarbones.

When correcting your posture, remember to not just straighten your back, but bring your shoulder blades back and chin tucked back.

## Standing Exercises
At first, try these with your back against the wall to be sure your posture is correct. Your back and heels should both be against the wall, and the chin tucked back with the back of against the wall -- not tilting the head back.

Try to do these two or three times a day, about 30 reps of each:

1. Sit in a chair with your feet hip-width apart, flat on the ground and pointed straight ahead.

2. Beginning the movement at the hip, roll your back slowly upward so that it finishes in a rounded position like a mad cat, your head down, chin resting on your chest. The lower half your back should be touching the chair back but your shoulders should not.

3. Then, beginning the movement with the hip, lower your back into an inverse arch, your head and tailbone up, your shoulder blades pinching toward each other. Your low back and shoulders should be touching the chair back but your mid-back should not.

4. Repeat 5 times each direction.
