## Benefits

Magnesium plays an important role in sleep regulation[^# The effect of magnesium supplementation on primary insomnia in elderly: A double-blind placebo-controlled clinical trial. https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/23853635/], with magnesium deficiencies correlated to insomnia and poor sleep quality (as well as anxiety, depression and migraines). Magnesium will also help regulate cortisol (stress) which affects sleep quality.

## Signs of Deficiency

## Recommended Form

Magnesium is elemental, so it is always sold as a compound, e.g. magnesium citrate, oxide, aspartate, chloride. 

It's important to understand this to know the amount of magnesium that is actually being consumed. For example, magnesium oxide is one magnesium atom bound together with one oxygen atom. It is “MgO”. An oxygen atom has a molar mass of 16, and a magnesium atom has a molar mass of 24. The entire molecule has a molar mass of 40 (16 +24). So in one molecule of magnesium oxide, we have 16/40 or 40% oxygen, and 24/40 or 60% magnesium; and 100 mg of pure magnesium oxide has 60 mg of “elemental” magnesium.

The less bioavailable forms of magnesium, such as magnesium citrate and [magnesium oxate](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/11794633/) have a laxative effect due to the body being unable to absorb the non-elemental magnesium.

### Magnesium Glycinate

Magnesium Glycinate (also known as magnesium bisglycinate) is a recommended form to take magnesium as a pill or powder. It's the most bioavailable among the common forms leading to little laxative effect. The glycine it is bounded with is also a recommended general supplement, a semi-essential amino acid found in collagenous foods.

You should be careful to check the supplement's label to make sure your magnesium glycinate is not buffered with other less desirable forms of magnesium. About 10% of unbuffered, unfilled magnesium glycinate is elemental magnesium. 

### Magnesium Chloride
Magnesium chloride is recommended for topical application.
