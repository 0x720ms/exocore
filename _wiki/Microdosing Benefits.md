## Microdosing and the placebo effect

Skeptics attribute the benefits of [microdosing to the placebo effect.](https://microdosinginstitute.com/science/microdosing-placebo-effect-research/) Matthew Johnson, a researcher who works with psilocybin and other hallucinogens at Johns Hopkins University, states that the scientific basis that microdosing is more than a placebo effect isn’t very solid right now; “the reported benefits of microdosing are credible and very interesting. But the claim that everything coincides and goes well, and you’re in a good mood, and you’re in the right flow, well, we all have those kinds of days. Even without pharmaceutical help”, he adds. “If you expect to get days like that, you’re more likely to get that,” he continues. “It’s actually not that different from the feeling you get from a very low dose of amphetamine or some other stimulant.”

Scholars like [Dr. James Fadiman](https://microdosinginstitute.com/microdosing-101/james-fadiman/) argue that Johnson is a conscientious skeptic for thinking that microdosers may have a placebo-like reaction, but agrees that further research is necessary. Fadiman believes that the benefits from microdosing are more than just a placebo after analyzing over 1850 microdosing reports he has received. The majority of these microdosers have reported major benefits—physically, mentally, and spirtually —and their experiences are very similar to one another. These people come from all over the world, have never spoken to each other, nor have they influenced each other in their experiences. For him, this is enough proof that the benefits of microdosing are more than just a placebo effect.

## What are the disadvantages of microdosing?

Out of the more than 1850 reports [Dr. James Fadiman](https://microdosinginstitute.com/microdosing-101/james-fadiman/) and Sophia Korb have analyzed for their published paper “[Might Microdosing Psychedelics Be Safe and Beneficial? An Initial Exploration](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30925850/)”, 75 people (less than 4% of reporters) expressed not to have had a positive experience with microdosing. The potential negative or unpleasant effects of microdosing mentioned in these reports include:

-   Fatigue – potentially because of a change in physical needs or as an indicator to address underlying emotional and/or physical needs
-   Tolerance (needing more of the substance each time to get the same effect) – It has not been scientifically proven yet, but Fadiman’s findings show that people report tolerance when microdosing every day instead of following one of the established  [microdosing protocols](https://microdosinginstitute.com/how-to/microdosing-protocols/)
-   Dealing with changes in your consciousness and your sensitivity can be challenging
-   Other [risks of microdosing](https://microdosinginstitute.com/microdosing-101/risks-safety-side-effects/) include nausea, headaches, or increased anxiety
