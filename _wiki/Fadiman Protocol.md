# Fadiman Protocol

The Fadiman Protocol (also known as the Beginners Protocol) is the most well-known [[Microdosing]] protocol. It’s named after Dr. James Fadiman, who created this protocol to observe the effects of mircodosing by clearly distinguishing between microdosing days and non-microdosing days.

Dr. James Fadiman’s protocol is an excellent basis for a first microdosing experiment. It assumes a 3-day cycle, which you follow for four to eight weeks.

DAY 1: 1st microdosing day
DAY 2: transition day
DAY 3: normal day
DAY 4: 2nd microdosing day

CYCLE: Continue this cycle for four to eight weeks
RESET: Two to four weeks rest
