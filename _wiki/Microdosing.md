# Microdosing

Microdosing is the practice of consuming a very small amount of a psychedelic substance, usually [[Volumetric Microdosing With LSD|5–10% of a regular dose]], with the intention of improving one’s quality of life. 

Microdosing does not cause classic psychedelic effects such as visual disturbances; instead, microdosers experience more subtle, “sub-hallucinogenic”, effects from the practice. Microdosing is a practice that yields best results when it’s done over an extended period of time following a [dosing scheme](https://microdosinginstitute.com/how-to/microdosing-protocols/)-- with the primary options being [[Fadiman Protocol]] or [[Stamets Stack]]. The exact effects and results of this practice depend greatly on the person, the [substance](https://microdosinginstitute.com/microdosing-101/substances/), the dosage and many other personal factors such as their intention, their expectations and mindset. 

#### The subtle effects of microdosing most often mentioned:

-   More energy
-   More creativity
-   Clearer thinking 
-   Increased problem-solving ability
-   Increased focus
-   Increased awareness
-   Positive mood
-   Greater emotional connection with people around you
-   Being more present

## Microdosing—Powerful substances in tiny amounts

Psychologists and psychiatrists believed that the drugs they studied in the fifties and sixties (especially [LSD](https://microdosinginstitute.com/microdosing-101/substances/microdosing-lsd/), [psilocybin](https://microdosinginstitute.com/microdosing-101/substances/microdosing-magic-mushrooms/), and [mescaline](https://microdosinginstitute.com/microdosing-101/substances/san-pedro-mescaline/)) brought subconscious parts of ourselves to the conscious mind. In this way, one could see and process repressed feelings and memories. What all psychedelic substances have in common is that they induce a classic trip experience at high doses, they’re not addictive, and especially when microdosing, they pose hardly [any risks in healthy people](https://microdosinginstitute.com/microdosing-101/risks-safety-side-effects/).

## Positive experiences with microdosing

Psychedelics, and microdosing in particular, still require a lot of scientific research to fully understand their workings. A large body of anecdotal evidence demonstrates that microdosing can lead to physical, mental, and emotional improvement. Since 2010, [Dr. James Fadiman](https://microdosinginstitute.com/microdosing-101/james-fadiman), an American transpersonal psychologist considered “The Father of Microdosing”., has been collecting microdosing reports from people around the world. His findings with numerous positive experiences serve as the foundation for the scientific quest into the world of microdosing.

## How does microdosing work?

What we do know is that psychedelic substances act on the serotonin (5-HT) receptors in our brain. Serotonin receptors are found throughout our nervous system and govern many aspects of our being, including mood, thinking, and bowel movements. Psychedelics bind most effectively to the 5HT-2A receptor, which is one of the receptors involved in learning, memory, and cognition. As a result, when consuming only a microdose of a psychedelic substance and thus avoiding the “classical trip,” it is believed that the brain can focus solely on the cognitive boost caused by these receptors.

#### Psychedelic substances suitable for microdosing

The following psychedelic substances are commonly and effectively used for microdosing:

- Psilocybin (the active ingredient in magic truffles and magic mushrooms)
- LSD
- 1P-LSD & 1cP-LSD
- Mescaline (the active ingredient in the San Pedro and peyote cacti)
- B. Caapi vine
