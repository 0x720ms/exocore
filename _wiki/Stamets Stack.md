# Stamets Stack

The Stamets Stack is a less common [[Microdosing]] protocol than the [[Fadiman Protocol]]. It follows a 4 day on, 3 day tolerance break schedule, and introduces two supplements along with the psychedelic microdose, Lion's Mane mushroom and Niacin:

1. Psilocybin: 
2. Lion's Man: 500 to 1000mg of Lion's Mane Extract powder, or 5 to 20 grams of fresh mushroom
3. [[Niacin|Niacin (Vitamin B3)]]: 100 to 200 mg

The logic behind this is that by taking the microdose four days in a row, the body will more easily gain the accumulative effects of the psychedelic microdose, while the three days off at the end of the week are enough for a tolerance break.

Stamets believes consuming Lion’s Mane over a period of time helps with cognitive functions, and he includes it in his stack as he believes it “reinforces psilocybin’s ability to occasion neurogenesis.”

Stamets recommends [[Niacin]] (B3) involved in the body’s energy and protein metabolism, on the basis that the majority of neurogenesis occurs in the nerve extremities; since [[niacin]] works as a flushing agent and carries the molecules of the other compounds across the blood-brain barrier, so it helps with the distribution of these important molecules.”

By adding psilocybin with Lion’s Mane and [[niacin|Niacin]], Stamets believes that the stack may have the potential to reduce anxiety and irritability, enhance cognitive functions and creativity, increase socializing, provide a greater general sense of well-being, and reduce the effects of aging.
