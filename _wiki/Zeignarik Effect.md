# Zeignarik Effect

Zeigarnik effect is the tendency to remember uncompleted tasks better than completed ones.

In the 1920s, Dr. Zeigarnik was dining with friends when she noticed that the restaurant staff were able to remember extremely long and complex orders – but once it was settled, their memory of it totally disappeared. Studying this psychological tendency further, Zeigarnik found that people were more likely to remember tasks that were in progress, than ones they had completed.

Once we start a task, our brain develops a task-specific tension. This tension improves cognitive access to relevant information – making it easier for us to complete it – and is only relieved when the task is finished. When we work on an interesting task and suddenly have to stop, this tension makes it hard for us to concentrate fully on anything else; we simply can’t settle until we can get back and finish it.

People who write down specific plans to complete a task at a later date experience fewer distracting thoughts about their unfinished work. So simply acknowledging that you have an outstanding task and writing down when you’ll complete it can reduce mental strain and allow you to relax – meaning you return to the task refreshed and ready to focus.
