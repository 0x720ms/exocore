# Linking

[[Zettelkasten System]]

Linking in this case means that you link each note to at least one other note (or else it will be an orphan). The more links to other notes a note has, the more useful it will probably be.

Luhmannâ€™s system was created the old-fashioned way, with pen and paper. He would give each note a unique ID number, written in the top left corner. To make associations with other ideas, he would cite the ID numbers of other notes.
