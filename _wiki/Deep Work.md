# Deep Work

-   **Deep work** is made up of professional activities performed in a state of distraction-free concentration that push your cognitive abilities to their limit. These efforts create new value, improve your skill and are hard to replicate (similar in concept to [purposeful practice](https://medium.com/the-mission/commit-to-purposeful-practice-not-all-practice-makes-perfect-2ca7350e1e80)); and
-   **Shallow work** is made up of non cognitively demanding, logistical style tasks often performed while distracted. These efforts tend to not create much new value in the world and are easy to replicate.

#### Structural changes that encourage deep work

1.  Disable _all_ incoming call/message notifications and badges  
    _In the last 10 years, including three years as an analyst at McKinsey, I’ve never missed a single professional or personal call or message that couldn’t wait._
2.  Become hard to reach  
    _[Set sender filters](http://calnewport.com/blog/2016/04/12/to-make-email-easier-we-must-make-it-harder/), filter emails with rules and use auto-responders to manage reply expectations. Ask people to respect your time and energy and they will._
3.  [Quit social media](http://calnewport.com/blog/2016/09/21/quit-social-media/)  
    _Experiment first with a secret, total 30 day social media fast if that helps. Like Cal I haven’t used social media in 8 years and my life has been much richer for it._ 
4.  Work in a quiet place  
    _Open-plan offices are the bane of deep work; a private room or library is best, [noise cancelling headphones](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B01L8OA2CC?tag=whywhathow-20) and [music without words](https://open.spotify.com/user/spotify/playlist/37i9dQZF1DX4sWSpwq3LiO) will do in a pinch._
5.  Work at a quiet time  
    _Ask the most effective people you know when they wake up. It will be early, when there’s nobody else up to disturb them._
6.  Limit internet access during deep work time
    -   Gather everything needed before beginning a session of deep work
    -   Alternate on and offline work time (see [Pomodoro technique](https://lifehacker.com/productivity-101-a-primer-to-the-pomodoro-technique-1598992730))
    -   Block problem websites during working hours (check out [Freedom](https://freedom.to/))

#### **Determine a fixed end point to the work day and stick to it**
1.  **Reframe our day towards our free-time instead of our work.**  
    Even if we enjoy our work we shouldn’t forget that financial gain is only a means to an end, not an end in itself.  
    If you could retire tomorrow what would you do with your free-time? Start seeing the time outside of work as if you were already retired.
2.  **Commit to a fixed end time to your day  
    **Make commitments to our children, book a yoga class, make plans with a friend, order a food delivery to our home etc…  
    Set a quitting time at the end of the day and do whatever it takes to make ourselves stick to it.
3.  **Plan backwards  
    **Once we have a quitting time we can start fighting [Parkinson’s law](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parkinson%27s_law) (the tendency for work to expand to fill the time available to it)  
    Identify the things which have to get done to day and plan backwards
4.  **Say no to shallow work and off-task commitments  
    **Run every incoming request through the process outlined at the start of these initiatives  
    Protect the end time by ruthlessly declining and then eliminating shallow work

#### Train Attention

1.  Become friends with boredom  
    _When standing in line or waiting for a friend, resist the temptation to instantly distract the mind with needless activity. Instead practice just being in the present moment._
2.  Practice thinking whilst walking  
    _Get into the habit of practicing thinking on a single, well defined problem or topic that is important to you whilst engaged in a physical activity that doesn’t require much mental exertion. This form of walking meditation not only improves attention but also has the added benefit of increasing productivity._
3.  Give the mind a work out with intense study or memorisation skills  
    _Spend time each day learning to to e.g., use your visual memory to [memorise a monologue](https://theartofliving.com/how-to-memorise-a-monologue/) or pack of cards. These aren’t just good tricks to impress friends at the pub. This kind of mental gymnastics also forces us to flex our attention muscles with far reaching implications for the rest of our lives._
