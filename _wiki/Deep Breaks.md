# Deep Breaks


-   Should not turn your attention to something you canâ€™t fulfil during your break
-   Should not involve anything that triggers self-distraction rituals (like cycling through a certain sequence of apps or websites)
-   Should not involve working on a task loosely related to your deep work task
-   Should not introduce anything that is stressful, complex or time consuming
- Should try to be no longer than 15 minutes
